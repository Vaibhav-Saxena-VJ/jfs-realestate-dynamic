            <p>In need of quick funds? Look no further than Loan Against Property, commonly referred to simply as Contracts. They stand out as one of the most straightforward and popular financing choices on the market. Typically, Contracts boast rapid approval and favorable interest rates.</p>
            <p>A Loan Against Property can essentially be labeled as a Contract Loan, as it entails mortgaging your property to mitigate the risk of non-payment or default in repaying the borrowed funds. To secure approval for such a loan, lenders typically scrutinize your personal and financial background, assessing factors such as nationality, age, occupation, income, and the market value of the collateral being offered.</p>

            <h2 class="display-6 mb-4">Benefits of Our Loan Against Property</h2>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    You maintain legal ownership of the property you offer as collateral.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    Due to its secured nature, a Loan Against Property generally garners quicker approval.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    Loan Against Property interest rates tend to be lower than those of personal loans.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    <strong>Loan Amount:</strong> The loan amount is determined by the value of the property you use as collateral. Typically, this allows you to borrow a larger sum compared to personal loans or other unsecured loans.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    <strong>Secured Loan:</strong> This type of loan is backed by your property, which serves as collateral. By using the property as security, the lender's risk is reduced, often resulting in lower interest rates compared to unsecured loans.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    <strong>Multipurpose:</strong> The loan amount can be utilized for a variety of purposes, providing you with the flexibility to meet different financial needs without any limitations.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    <strong>Flexible Tenure:</strong> The repayment period for a Loan Against Property is typically longer than for other types of loans, usually ranging from 5 to 20 years. This extended tenure results in lower monthly installments.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                    <strong>Improves Credit Scores:</strong> Successfully repaying a Loan Against Property can boost your credit score, as it reflects responsible borrowing habits.

                    <p>The basic criteria for home loan eligibility are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                            <strong>Nationality:</strong> You need to be a Citizen of India with documents to prove your claim.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                            <strong>Occupation and Income:</strong> Your lender will request your occupation and income details to assess your creditworthiness.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                            <strong>Credit History:</strong> Your three-digit Credit Score, reflecting your history of loan repayments and other credit activities, will significantly influence your eligibility for a LAP.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                            <strong>Banking Relationship:</strong> If your relationship with your lender is good, you're less likely to face LAP rejection and may receive improved terms on loan amount, interest rates, and fees.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                            <strong>Market Value of Property:</strong> Your lender decides the loan amount and terms based on your property's market value, which must exceed the calculated loan amount.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check me-2" style="color: #4DA9EA;"></i></span>
                            <strong>Title of Property:</strong> Your lender requires you to be the property's current owner and provide clear title for co-ownership. Also, the property shouldn't be Contractd elsewhere.
                        </li>
